        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Rice has been a staple food for thousands of years. It is used as the base for a number of rice dishes across the globe and is also commonly eaten on its own or as a side dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>A pot with a lid</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice</li>
        <li>Pour rice into the pot and add water. A good ratio is 2 parts of water for every 1 part of rice bing cooked.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil</li>
        <li>Cover the pot. Turn the heat down and allow rice to simmer for 15 minutes</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>An alternative way to cook rice without measuring the amount of water is to add rice and any amount of water that covers the rice. Then bring the pot to a boil. Let the water boil off until the water is at the level of the rice, cover, turn the heat down, and let simmer for 12 minutes.</p>
